# Collection Management with NiceGUI

----

## Summary

This Python application runs a NiceGUI instance that helps you manage your collection items hosted on MongoDB.  All a
user has to update locally is their secrets.env file and the app will use that data to connect to MongoDB.  For further
details, please see the application documents [provided here](https://erics0110.github.io/what-a-nice-collection-gui/)!
